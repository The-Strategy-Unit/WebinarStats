Code to take the AttendeeReport.csv created after a Teams Live Event, clean the data and generate some stats

The idea of this is to take the auto-generated csv reports from Teams Live events and generate some data about the attendance at the event.
Initially the filename, its location and the date and start and finish times are hard-coded into the script. Eventualy I would like this to maybe be a small shiny app where I can select the file and enter the relevant event details and then present a few stats
